# Git Basics

## Configuration

Set User and E-Mail

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@yourdomain.com
```

Unset Credentials

```
git config --global --unset credential.helper
```

## Basic Git Commands

Init Git:

```
git init
```

Add all files to Git:

```
git add .
```

Add a specific file to Git:

```
git add file.txt | *.ts
```

Commit files:

```
git commit -m "your checkin comment"
```

## Status & Updates

Show Commit logs:

```
git log
```

Check for remote updates:

```
git remote update
```

Show Status (Adds/Delets/Changes):

```
git status
```

## Branching

List Branches:

```
git branch
```

Create Branch:

```
git branch feature/myfeature
```

Push new Branch to remote:

```
git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```

Switch to Branch:

```
git checkout [name_of_your_branch]
```

> Note: When switching branches it is always good advice to check the status with `git status` on a windows machine. When there are changes from other branches on the disk you can clean the branch using `git clean -f`

Merge Branch:

```
git merge [branch_to_merge]
```

> Note: You might have to switch to the branch that you might want to merge into befor executing merge

## Dealing with special Commits

Get a spcific Commit:

```
git checkout <sha1>
```

sha1:

![commits](_images/commits.png)

![sha1](_images/sha1.png)

> Note: This will result in a detached Head.

If you want to delete your changes associated with the detached HEAD:

```
git checkout master
```

If you want to keep the detached state save it into a new branch and continue from there:

```
git branch save-detached-head
```

> Note: You will have to switch to the branch you saved to afterwards

## Tags

Create Lightweight tag :

```
git tag -l v1.1.0
```

Create Annotated tag :

```
git tag -a v2.0.1 -m "fixed Bug on replaced data layer. do not use v.2.0.0"
```

List all tags:

```
git tag
```

Show a specific tag:

```
git show v2.0.1
```

Push tags to Remote:

```
git push origin v2.0.1 | git push --tags
```

Delete tag:

```
git tag -d v2.0.1
```

Checkout tag:

```
git checkout 2.0.1
```

## Configure ignored files

To Configure ignored files add a `.gitignore` file to the root of your project. A valid `.gitignore` file can be generated at https://www.gitignore.io/
